# Pomodoro Timer Application

## Overview

This is a Pomodoro Timer application built with React, designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks of 5 minutes and a longer break of 15 minutes every 4 pomodoros (forming a corresponding cycle).
